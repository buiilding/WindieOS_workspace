# AGENTS.md
tart: say hi + 1 motivating line.
Work style: telegraph; noun-phrases ok; drop grammar; min tokens.

## Agent Protocol
- Workspace: `/mnt/E/Assistants/WindieOS_workspace`.
- PRs: use `gh pr view/diff` (no URLs).
- “Make a note” => edit AGENTS.md (shortcut; not a blocker). Ignore `CLAUDE.md`.
- Need upstream file: stage in `/tmp/`, then cherry-pick; never overwrite tracked.
- Bugs: add regression test when it fits.
- Keep files <~500 LOC; split/refactor as needed.
- Commits: Conventional Commits (`feat|fix|refactor|build|ci|chore|docs|style|perf|test`).
- Editor: `code <path>`.
- CI: `gh run list/view` (rerun/fix til green).
- Prefer end-to-end verify; if blocked, say what’s missing.
- New deps: quick health check (recent releases/commits, adoption).
- Slash cmds: `~/.codex/prompts/`.
- Web: search early; quote exact errors; prefer 2024–2025 sources.
- Style: telegraph. Drop filler/grammar. Min tokens (global AGENTS + replies).
- Context: always read "Agents.md" file if it exists in other codebases.

## Docs
- Start: run docs list (`scripts/docs-list` script if present in some codebases; ignore if not installed); open docs before coding.
- Follow links until domain makes sense; honor `Read when` hints.
- Keep notes short; update docs when behavior/API changes (no ship w/o docs).
- Add `read_when` hints on cross-cutting docs.

## PR Feedback
- Active PR: `gh pr view --json number,title,url --jq '"PR #\(.number): \(.title)\n\(.url)"'`.
- PR comments: `gh pr view …` + `gh api …/comments --paginate`.
- Replies: cite fix + file/line; resolve threads only after fix lands.
- When merging a PR: thank the contributor in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Flow & Runtime
- Use repo’s package manager/runtime; no swaps w/o approval.
- Use Codex background for long jobs; tmux only for interactive/persistent (debugger/server).

## Build / Test
- Before handoff: run full gate (lint/typecheck/tests/docs).
- CI red: `gh run list/view`, rerun, fix, push, repeat til green.
- Keep it observable (logs, panes, tails, MCP/browser tools).
- Release: read `docs/RELEASING.md` (or find best checklist if missing).

## Git
- Safe by default: `git status/diff/log`. Push only when user asks.
- `git checkout` ok for PR review / explicit request.
- Branch changes require user consent.
- Destructive ops forbidden unless explicit (`reset --hard`, `clean`, `restore`, `rm`, …).
- Delete unused or obsolete files when your changes make them irrelevant (refactors, feature removals, etc.), and revert files only when the change is yours or explicitly requested. If a git operation leaves you unsure about other agents' in-flight work, stop and coordinate instead of deleting.
- Before attempting to delete a file to resolve a local type/lint failure, stop and ask the user. Other agents are often editing adjacent files; deleting their work to silence an error is never acceptable without explicit approval.
- NEVER edit `.env` or any environment variable files; only the user may change them.
- Coordinate with other agents before removing their in-progress edits; don't revert or delete work you didn't author unless everyone agrees.
- Moving/renaming and restoring files is allowed.
- ABSOLUTELY NEVER run destructive git operations (e.g., `git reset --hard`, `rm`, `git checkout`/`git restore` to an older commit) unless the user gives an explicit, written instruction in this conversation. Treat these commands as catastrophic; if you are even slightly unsure, stop and ask before touching them. (When working within Cursor or Codex Web, these git limitations do not apply; use the tooling's capabilities as needed.)
- Never use `git restore` (or similar commands) to revert files you didn't author; coordinate with other agents instead so their in-progress work stays intact.
- Prefer HTTPS remotes; flip SSH->HTTPS before pull/push.
- Commit helper on PATH: `committer` (bash). Prefer it; if repo has `./scripts/committer`, use that.
- Commit message: Conventional Commit subject + short description body (when it helps review). Example:
  - `feat(frontend-dashboard): delete semantic memory entries`
  - blank line
  - bullets: what changed, where wired, tests added
- Always double-check `git status` before any commit.
- Keep commits atomic: commit only the files you touched and list each path explicitly. For tracked files run `git commit -m "<scoped message>" -- path/to/file1 path/to/file2`. For brand-new files, use the one-liner `git restore --staged :/ && git add "path/to/file1" "path/to/file2" && git commit -m "<scoped message>" -- path/to/file1 path/to/file2`.
- Default commit behavior: auto-commit after each completed logical change; do not wait for user prompt.
- Quote any git paths containing brackets or parentheses (e.g., `src/app/[candidate]/**`) when staging or committing so the shell does not treat them as globs or subshells.
- When running git rebase, avoid opening editors; export `GIT_EDITOR=:` and `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=:` (or pass `--no-edit`) so the default messages are used automatically.
- Never amend commits unless you have explicit written approval in the task thread.
- After committing work, update `CHANGELOG.md` with the changes.
- Don’t delete/rename unexpected stuff; stop + ask.
- No repo-wide S/R scripts; keep edits small/reviewable.
- Avoid manual `git stash`; if Git auto-stashes during pull/rebase, that’s fine (hint, not hard guardrail).
- If user types a command (“pull and push”), that’s consent for that command.
- Big review: `git --no-pager diff --color=never`.
- Multi-agent: check `git status/diff` before edits; ship small commits.

## Language/Stack Notes
- Python: Black + mypy + pylint; type hints required; Google docstrings.
- TypeScript/JS: Prettier + ESLint; React functional components with hooks.
- Repo dev loops:
  - WindieOS: backend `python -m backend.src.main` (needs `OPENAI_API_KEY`), frontend `npm run dev`, Electron `npm run electron`.
  - WindieOS envs: backend/runtime+backend tests => `conda activate jarvis`; frontend app/sidecar/frontend tests => `conda activate frontend_jarvis`.
  - openclaw: Node >= 22, prefer `pnpm`; dev loop `pnpm gateway:watch`.

## Critical Thinking
- Fix root cause (not band-aid).
- Unsure: read more code; if still stuck, ask w/ short options.
- Conflicts: call out; pick safer path.
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user.
- Leave breadcrumb notes in thread.

### committer
- Commit helper (PATH). Stages only listed paths; required here. Repo may also ship `scripts/committer`.

### trash
- Move files to Trash: `trash …` (system command).

### bin/docs-list / scripts/docs-list.ts
- Optional. Lists `docs/` + enforces front-matter. Ignore if `bin/docs-list` not installed. Rebuild: `bun build scripts/docs-list.ts --compile --outfile bin/docs-list`.

### bin/browser-tools / scripts/browser-tools.ts
- Chrome DevTools helper. Cmds: `start`, `nav`, `eval`, `screenshot`, `pick`, `cookies`, `inspect`, `kill`.
- Rebuild: `bun build scripts/browser-tools.ts --compile --target bun --outfile bin/browser-tools`.

### gh
- GitHub CLI for PRs/CI/releases. Given issue/PR URL (or `/pull/5`): use `gh`, not web search.
- Examples: `gh issue view <url> --comments -R owner/repo`, `gh pr view <url> --comments --files -R owner/repo`.

### Slash Commands
- Global: `~/.codex/prompts/`. Repo-local: `docs/slash-commands/`.
- Common: `/handoff`, `/pickup`.

### tmux
- Use only when you need persistence/interaction (debugger/server).
- Quick refs: `tmux new -d -s codex-shell`, `tmux attach -t codex-shell`, `tmux list-sessions`, `tmux kill-session -t codex-shell`.

<frontend_aesthetics>
Avoid “AI slop” UI. Be opinionated + distinctive.

Do:
- Typography: pick a real font; avoid Inter/Roboto/Arial/system defaults.
- Theme: commit to a palette; use CSS vars; bold accents > timid gradients.
- Motion: 1–2 high-impact moments (staggered reveal beats random micro-anim).
- Background: add depth (gradients/patterns), not flat default.

Avoid: purple-on-white clichés, generic component grids, predictable layouts.
